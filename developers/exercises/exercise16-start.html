  <!-- EXAMPLE STARTS HERE -->
  <div id="message" class="warning"></div>
  <!-- EXAMPLE ENDS HERE -->

  <p>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age 
  of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, 
  it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was 
  the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter 
  of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, 
  we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the 
  other way.</p>
